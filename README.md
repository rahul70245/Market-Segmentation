# Market-Segmentation
This is a project given in my on going internship with feynn labs. 
In this task I had to get knowledge of market segmentation and perform the same with McDonald's dataset with Machine Learning concepts and models in Python.
In this I have trained a k-means machine learning model to do the market segmentation for the mc-donald dataset and predict which consumer to target for which products.
